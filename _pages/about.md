# About Me
* I was a research engineer with a focus on face recognition and video understanding in Huawei 2012 lab. I received my master degree in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). During my master, i exchanged to [University of Maryland, college park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where i designed a system that won 1st in a question answering competition called [QANTA](https://sites.google.com/view/qanta/past-events/dec-15-2018). 
* My board research interests lie in deep learning as well as its applications in natural language processing and computer vision, such as machine translation, question answering, fact checking, face recognition, and video understanding. Particularly, I'm interested in application of knowledge graph and generating better semantic representations using probabilistic methods.
