# About Me
* I was a research engineer with a focus on face recognition and video understanding in Huawei 2012 lab. I received my master degree in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). During my master, i exchanged to [University of Maryland, college park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where i designed a system that won 1st in a question answering competition called [QANTA](https://sites.google.com/view/qanta/past-events/dec-15-2018). 
* My research interests lie in deep learning as well as its applications in natural language processing, such as machine translation, question answering and fact checking. Particularly, I'm interested in generating better semantic representations using deep learning models.
