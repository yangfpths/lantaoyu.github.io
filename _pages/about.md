# About Me
* I'm a research engineer with a focus on face recognition and video understanding in HuaWei 2012 lab. I received my master degree in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). During my master, i exchanged to [University of Maryland, college park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where i designed a system that won 1st in a question answering competition called [QANTA](https://sites.google.com/view/qanta/past-events/dec-15-2018). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/).
